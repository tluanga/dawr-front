            A stock re-order report indicates when a re-order of goods is necessary. Re-order points are typically unique to each product since they are a factor of delivery lead times, sales, and safety stock. Additionally, a product kept at multiple stock locations may have different re-order points depending on the location of warehouse and sales throughput from that location. Using a stock re-order report for each stock location to understand what products to replenish, helps you avoid low-stock and stock outs situations.
