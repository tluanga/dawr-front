            A multi-stock location inventory report enables your business to track inventory across all of your stock locations, warehouses, or distribution centers. With it, you can quickly gain visibility into the inventory quantities at each site. This information allows you to create a more efficient production process. If one location is low on inventory, you have the option of deciding if you should order more stock from your suppliers or if transferring inventory from a warehouse in close proximity would be better.
